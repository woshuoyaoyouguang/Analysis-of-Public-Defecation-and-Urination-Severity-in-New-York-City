# Analysis-of-Public-Defecation-and-Urination-Severity-in-New-York-City
• Consolidated a decade’s worth of public defecation and urination complaints data from the New York Public Data Platform, integrated with other relevant data sources, cleaned the data by removing missing values, and conducted feature engineering to ensure data quality and completeness.

• Applied K-means clustering to segment NYC into three distinct regions based on the severity of public defecation and urination incidents.

• Employed various classification algorithms, including XGBoost, SVM, and Logistic Regression, to categorize these regions. Upon determining the most accurate model, utilized SHAP values to identify the primary factors influencing the severity of the public sanitation issue.
